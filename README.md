# INTRODUCTION

* Webpack - well documented and created to incoroporate only what you need
* Sass - a simple custom grid is provided with minimal styling
* ES Next - write modern javascript

As more pieces are added and changed they will be updated here!

# Contributing and Installation
If you would like to contribute to the project or poke around the source, then you're
in the right place!

First, like nearly all projects we'll perform an npm install. You'll need to have node
installed first which you can learn about [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)!

`npm install`

Some of the command line cli's you'll need are below. Note that if you're on Ubuntu or another Linux
distribution you might need `sudo` in front of your commands. On a mac, follow this tutorial to ensure
that you don't have to worry about `sudo`!

`npm install -g karma-cli`
